<p>
  Terrorism exists all around the world; just look at the map above. It’s terrifying. 
  In the past, danger seemed to have been contained to far away, third world and developing countries. 
  Yet, with the rise of ISIS, the fear of terrorism is increasing. 
  ISIS has been affecting the Middle East for years, but it has recently directly affected the Western world. 
  Just last year ISIS killed 130 people in Paris, and at the beginning of this year they attacked Brussels, another major metropolitan city in Europe. 
  The media is quick to portray terrorism as an outside force, especially from groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIS, but it is important to remember that terrorism also exists within the United States. 
  Terrorism can both occur within the United States and it can be committed by U.S. citizens. In 2013 the country felt the impact of terrorism at home with the Boston Bombings.
  School shootings such as the one in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School or the one at Virginia Tech in 2007 are other examples of terrorism within our own country. 
  Imperial Wizard, Ku Klux Klan leader’s endorsement of Presidential hopeful Donald Trump is another reminder of the domestic terrorism within the U.S.

  With the media’s heavy coverage and the seeming increased threat of danger in the world, there is also an increased fear of travel. But there shouldn’t be. 
  The likelihood of being in the exact place at the exact same time as a terror attack is very slim. 
  According to an article from Rolling Stone, between the years of 2004 and 2013, there were more than 316,000 deaths by firearm, while there were 313 deaths by terrorism in that same time period (Dickinson). 
  You can die anywhere and at any time, so there is no need to stop traveling for a fear of terrorism. 
  You could easily die at home and not have seen the world at all, rather than taking the chance (that does little to increase your overall risk) to travel. 
  Of course it is important to consider the social and political atmosphere of your chosen destination, but it is also important to remember that isolating yourself in your home country does not guarantee protection. 
  Don’t miss out on seeing the world just because there’s a possibility that you could be in danger. 
  Take a chance and see the world.
